# Phanisana

**Phanisana** is a powerful PHP library that transforms numbers, dates, and times into their full-text equivalents in the Malagasy üá≤üá¨ language. Whether you're localizing applications, building educational tools, or creating systems with Malagasy users in mind, Phanisana offers a reliable and intuitive solution.

The name **Phanisana** is a blend of **PHP** and the Malagasy word **fanisana**, meaning *"counting"* or *"calculation"*‚Äîperfectly reflecting the library‚Äôs purpose and roots.

## üì¶ Installation

Install the package via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer require mamyraoby/phanisana
```

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

First, make sure Composer‚Äôs autoloader is included (optional if already loaded by your framework):

```php
// Include Composer's autoloader if it hasn't been loaded elsewhere
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use MamyRaoby\Phanisana\Converter\NumberConverter;

$converter = new NumberConverter();

echo $converter->toWords(7);            // fito
echo $converter->toWords(69);           // sivy amby enimpolo
echo $converter->toWords(2025);         // dimy amby roapolo sy roa arivo
```

Or use the global helper function for shorter syntax:

```php
echo phanisana_convert_number(7);       // fito
echo phanisana_convert_number(2025);    // dimy amby roapolo sy roa arivo
```

More usage examples and details are available in the [Usage Guide](https://phanisana.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).
