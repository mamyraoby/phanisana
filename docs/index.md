# Welcome to Phanisana

**Phanisana** is a robust and flexible PHP library designed to convert numbers, dates, and times into their full-text representations in the Malagasy 🇲🇬 language. Whether you're developing business software, educational tools, or localization-ready apps, Phanisana helps make your content more accessible to Malagasy speakers.

The name **Phanisana** is a creative fusion of **PHP**, the programming language it’s built on, and **fanisana**, the Malagasy word for "counting" or "calculation". This reflects the library’s core purpose and cultural roots.

## ✅ Features

- Converts any integer into its correct Malagasy number word.
- Supports numbers from 0 up to `PHP_INT_MAX` (typically 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 on 64-bit systems).
- Properly handles large numeric scales including:
  - Millions (*tapitrisa*)
  - Billions (*lavitrisa*)
  - Trillions (*arivo lavitrisa*) and beyond.
- Easy-to-use API with clean and expressive syntax.
- Designed with extensibility in mind for future date/time support.
